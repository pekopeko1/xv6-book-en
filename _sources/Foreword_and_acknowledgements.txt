Foreword and acknowledgements

This is a draft text intended for a class on operating systems. It explains the main concepts of operating systems by studying an example kernel, named xv6. xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie’s and Ken Thompson’s Unix Version 6 (v6). xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6, but is implemented in ANSI C for an x86-based multiprocessor.

The text should be read along with the source code for xv6. This approach is inspired by John Lions’s Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14, 2000)). See http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828 for pointers to on-line resources for v6 and xv6.

We have used this text in 6.828, the operating system class at MIT. We thank the faculty, TAs, and students of 6.828 who all directly or indirectly contributed to xv6. In particular, we would like to thank Austin Clements and Nickolai Zeldovich.
